    2. **Important**: The function that drives one of the challenges is `updateCurrentPage(str)` which takes 1 parameter, a string of the word to display as the current page. This function is not included in the code of the page, along with a few other things, are linked via an external js file. Make sure you do not delete this line.  
5. Create a branch called M3-Challenge-HW if you haven't yet
6. Add this template to that branch (git add/git commit)
7. Make a pull request for this branch once you push it
8. You may manually deploy the HW branch to dev to get the evidence for the below prompts
9. Create a new file **m3_submission.md** file in the hw branch and fill it with the output generated from this page (be careful not to paste more than once)
10. Add, commit, and push the submission file
11. Close the pull request by merging it to dev (double-check all looks good on dev)
12. Manually create a new pull request from dev to prod (i.e., base: prod <- compare: dev)
13. Complete the merge to deploy to production
14. Submit the direct link of the m3_submission.md from the prod branch to Canvas for this submission

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Briefly explain how you made the navigation horizontal</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>To make the navigation horizontal, I changed the display property of the list<br>items (&lt;li&gt;) to float: left; within the &lt;nav&gt; element&#39;s styling. This causes each<br>list item to sit next to the previous one on the same line,<br>rather than stacking vertically.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how you remove the navigation list item markers</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>To remove the list item markers in the navigation, the list-style-type was set<br>to none within the &lt;style&gt; section for the nav ul selector. This CSS<br>rule targets the unordered list (&lt;ul&gt;) inside the navigation (&lt;nav&gt;) element and removes<br>the default markers (bullets) that are usually present.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> Briefly explain how you gave the navigation a background</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>To give the navigation a background, I assigned a background color to the<br>&lt;nav&gt; element's unordered list (&lt;ul&gt;) in the CSS.&nbsp;<br></div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> Briefly explain how you made the links (or their surrounding area) change color on mouseover/hover</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>To make the links change color when the mouse hovers over them, I<br>used the :hover pseudo-class in CSS. This pseudo-class applies styles to an element<br>when it is being hovered over by the mouse cursor. I targeted the<br>anchor (&lt;a&gt;) elements within the navigation list and changed their background color upon<br>hover.<br></div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 5: </em> Briefly explain how you changed the challenge list bullet points to checkmarks (✓)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>To change the bullet points of the challenge list to checkmarks, I used<br>the CSS ::before pseudo-element along with the content property on the &lt;ul&gt; elements.<br>Specifically, I targeted all &lt;li&gt; elements to insert content before the text of<br>each list item. By setting the content property to &#39;✓&#39;, a checkmark is<br>inserted before each list item.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 6: </em> Briefly explain how you made the first character of the h1 tags and anchor tags uppercased</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>To uppercase the first character of the &lt;h1&gt; tags and the anchor (&lt;a&gt;)<br>tags, I used the CSS ::first-letter pseudo-element. This pseudo-element targets the first letter<br>of a block-level element, allowing you to apply specific styles to just that<br>letter. In this case, I applied the text-transform: uppercase; property to the ::first-letter<br>pseudo-element for both &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;a&gt; tags, which converts the targeted first letter<br>to uppercase.</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 7: </em> Briefly explain/describe your custom styling of your choice</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>For my custom styling, I chose to enhance the visual appeal of the<br>&lt;h1&gt; tags by applying a specific color and increasing the font size. The<br>color chosen was a bright blue (#007bff), which stands out against the darker<br>background of the navigation bar, creating a visually appealing contrast. Additionally, by increasing<br>the font size to 2em, the &lt;h1&gt; text becomes more prominent on the<br>page, drawing attention to the main title or heading it represents.</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 8: </em> Briefly explain how the styling for the challenge list doesn't impact the navigation list</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>The navigation list styling is applied specifically to nav ul and nav ul<br>li a, targeting only the unordered list (&lt;ul&gt;) within the &lt;nav&gt; element and<br>its anchor (&lt;a&gt;) children. This ensures that the styles, such as background color,<br>layout, and hover effects, only affect the navigation bar. For the challenge list<br>(and all other lists not within the &lt;nav&gt; element), I used a global<br>ul selector to apply styles, like changing bullet points to checkmarks. However, to<br>ensure these global styles didn't affect the navigation list, no specific styling that<br>could interfere with the navigation's unique look was applied globally.</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 9: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the h1 tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>To update the content of the &lt;h1&gt; tag with the link text when<br>a navigation link is clicked, I implemented a JavaScript function called updatePageContent. This<br>function is triggered by the onclick event attached to each navigation link (&lt;a&gt;<br>element). When a user clicks on one of these links, the function retrieves<br>the text content of the clicked link and then updates the &lt;h1&gt; tag's<br>content with this text. Additionally, it updates the page's title to match the<br>link text.</div><div><br></div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 10: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the title tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>To update the content of the &lt;title&gt; tag with the link text, the<br>same JavaScript function updatePageContent was used. This function is called when any of<br>the navigation links are clicked. It takes the text content of the clicked<br>link as an argument. Within this function, there's a line of code specifically<br>designed to update the &lt;title&gt; tag's content.&nbsp;</div><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Comment briefly talking about what you learned and/or any difficulties you encountered and how you resolved them (or attempted to)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Through this task, I revisited essential web development concepts and tackled a few<br>interesting challenges. I learned more about CSS specificity and the importance of precise<br>selectors to ensure styling is applied correctly and exclusively where intended. Implementing dynamic<br>content updates using JavaScript was particularly enlightening, reinforcing my understanding of DOM manipulation.<br>I encountered some challenges with ensuring styles did not overlap between different elements,<br>which I addressed by carefully structuring CSS selectors. This exercise was a valuable<br>practice in combining CSS and JavaScript to enhance user interaction and the overall<br>aesthetics of a webpage, reminding me of the detailed, methodical approach required in<br>web development.<br></p><br></td></tr>
